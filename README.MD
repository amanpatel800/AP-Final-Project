# The Upcoming Updates to New York City Zoning with the City of Yes for Economic Opporuntiy
This project aims to combine my pervious work on the zoning code and the City of Yes proposal from the Mayor's Office into a visual map meant for those who have zero to very limited information about the city's zoning code. The site provides a breif overview of the zoning code then describes some of the key changes the City of Yes is hoping to achieve. 

## Step 1:
Before beggining this project, I collected mapping data from NYCOpen Data and uploaded the data into MapBox Studio. I began adding the needed layers. The layers include:
zoning: the overall zoning map
special-districts: the map of all of the special districts 
sub-districts: the outlines of all of the special subdistricts
subway lines: each of the subway lines is its own layer in style
amends: this is the layer to display all of the potential amendemants to the zoning resolution
heights: the zoning areas where there are height restrictions 
commerical: all of the commerical districts 
trucks: the lines of the trucking routes throughout the city 
fidi and kipsbay: the neighboorhood layers 

the image below shows the exact names of the layers if you would like to use this style in your projects!
