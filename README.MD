# The Upcoming Updates to New York City Zoning with the City of Yes for Economic Opportunity
This project aims to combine my previous work on the zoning code and the City of Yes proposal from the Mayor's Office into a visual map meant for those who have zero to very limited information about the city's zoning code. The site provides a brief overview of the zoning code and then describes some of the key changes the City of Yes is hoping to achieve. 
## The site:
Here is the link to the live site: https://amanpatel800.github.io/AP-Final-Project/

 Please explore, and if there are any updates or requests, please email me at amanpatel800@gmail.com, and I will do my best to update this project. My goal is to make this project as helpful as possible, and I thank you for your time and input!

## Step 1:
Before beginning this project, I collected mapping data from NYCOpen Data and uploaded the data into MapBox Studio. I began adding the needed layers. The raw GeoJSON data can also be found here within this GitHub repo. The layers include:
zoning: the overall zoning map
special-districts: the map of all of the special districts 
sub-districts: the outlines of all of the special subdistricts
subway lines: each of the subway lines is its own layer in style
amends: this is the layer to display all of the potential amendments to the zoning resolution
heights: the zoning areas where there are height restrictions 
commercial: all of the commercial districts 
trucks: the lines of the trucking routes throughout the city 
fidi and kipsbay: the neighborhood layers 

The image to the below shows the exact names of the layers if you would like to use this style in your projects!

## Step 2:
From here, I pulled the code for storytelling from MapBox and began editing and adding layers to the map. The first image I wanted to display was an overview of the zoning code as it stands today. The image below shows this:

## Step 3:
One of the more confusing aspects of the zoning codes is the classification system into Special Districts and Sub-Districts. To help the reader better understand this, I displayed the differences visually. The image below shows the Fifth Ave subdistrict within the Midtown Special District.

## Step 4: 
From here, getting the information for the EDC, NYC Planning, and related sources was a journey down memory lane as I have extensive experience working on zoning through the Future of Fifth project. I gathered the sources, implemented the information into the code, and enjoyed getting the layers to display properly.
